My croft is a smart and open source artificial intelligence
Normally, I'm good at responding to voice. However, it is too loud in here to hear you
I can do anything from telling you the weather to spelling out a word you don't know
Here is a demonstration of how I can be talked to: Hey my croft. What's the weather? It is currently sunny with a high of 85 and a low of 72.
